The input given is a SMILES string, and they want the answer in the form of the Murcco scaffold in SMILES format. The definition provided is: \"The Murcko scaffold is obtained by removing all side chains, functional groups, and exocyclic modifications, leaving only the ring systems and connecting bonds.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the given SMILES to understand the original molecule. The input is Cn1c(=O)c(Oc2ccc(F)cc2F)cc2cnc(N3CCCC(O)C3)nc21. Breaking that down, there's a ring system with a carbonyl group (c=O), an ether linkage (Oc...), a fluorine-substituted benzene ring (F), another ring system with a nitrogen-containing ring (N3CCCC(O)C3), and a pyrimidine-like ring.\n\nThe key is to identify the rings and their connections.
