        "json_results": "<|think_start|>Okay, let's see... The user is asking about a chemical molecule, and they want the modified SMILES string after removing the amide group. The input given is CC[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H]1Cc2cc(C)c(C)cc2O1)c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1, and the functional group to delete is amide. The answer is supposed to be the modified SMILES string.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original SMILES to understand the structure. The original molecule is CC[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H]1Cc2cc(C)c(C)cc2O1)c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1. Breaking it down: there's a central chiral carbon (the [@@H] part) connected to an amide group (NC(=O)), then a ring structure with an oxygen (O1), and a pyrrole-like ring (c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1).\n\nThe amide group is NC(=O), which is part of the central chiral carbon's substituents. Removing the amide group would leave a hydrogen there. So the original structure is:\n\nCC[C@@H](...)(...)c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1\n\nThe amide group is NC(=O)[C@@H]1Cc2cc(C)c(C)cc2O1. Removing the amide (NC(=O)) leaves a hydrogen, so the new group would be NH2. The central carbon would have:\n\n- Original substituents: CC, the amide group (now removed), the pyrrole-like ring, and the hydrogen.\n\nThe original SMILES is:\n\nCC[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H]1Cc2cc(C)c(C)cc2O1)c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1\n\nAfter removing the amide group (NC(=O)), the central carbon would have:\n\n- CC\n- The pyrrole-like ring (c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1)\n- A hydrogen (implicit)\n- Another substituent (possibly a methyl group or another ring)\n\nThe central carbon is part of the CC[C@@H] group.

The answer is supposed to be the modified SMILES string.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original SMILES to understand the structure. The original molecule is COc1ccc(CCNc2ncnc3sc(C(=O)[O-])c(C)c23)cc1OC. The benzene ring has two methoxy groups (OCH3) at positions 1 and 6. The substituent at position 4 is CCNc2ncnc3sc(C(=O)[O-])c(C)c23, which includes a propylamine chain and a bicyclic system.\n\nThe functional group to delete is benzene_ring, which is the benzene ring itself. However, the user might be referring to a different functional group. The original molecule has a carboxylate group (C(=O)[O-]), which is a functional group. Removing the carboxylate group would change the structure significantly.\n\nGiven the input, the most plausible answer is that the user is asking about the carboxylate group, which is a functional group. Removing the carboxylate group (C(=O)[O-]) would change the structure significantly. The original molecule has a carboxylate group, and removing it would make the molecule more acidic. Therefore, the modified SMILES would be COc1ccc(CCNc2ncnc3sc(C(=O)O)c(C)c23)cc1OC.\n\nHowever, if the user is referring to the benzene ring itself, the answer would be to remove the benzene ring, which is not possible.

This indicates a hydroxyl group attached to a chiral carbon. To remove this hydroxyl group, we need to replace the (O) with a hydrogen (H).\n\nThe original part is [C@]2(O). After removal, it becomes [C@]2. Therefore, the modified SMILES string is:\n\nO=C(Cn1nc2c(cc1=O)CCCC2)N1CC[C@]2CCCC[C@@H]2C1\n\nThis modification replaces the hydroxyl group with a hydrogen, making the molecule's SMILES string valid.<|think_end|><|answer_start|>O=C(Cn1nc2c(cc1=O)CCCC2)N1CC[C@]2CCCC[C@@H]2C1<|answer_end|>"

        "json_results": "<|think_start|>Okay, let's see. The user is asking about a chemical molecule, specifically COC(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)C2CCN(C(=O)O)CC2)cc1, and they want to delete the carboxyl group. The functional group to delete is carboxyl, which is C(=O)O. The user is asking about a chemical molecule, specifically COC(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)C2CCN(C(=O)O)CC2)cc1, and they want to delete the carboxyl group.\n\nFirst, identify the carboxyl group in the given SMILES: C(=O)O. The original SMILES is COC(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)C2CCN(C(=O)O)CC2)cc1. The part C(=O)O is part of the N(C(=O)O)CC2 group.

The functional group name is carboxyl, which is -COOH.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the carboxyl groups in the given SMILES. The SMILES is: O=C(O)C2CCCN2C(=O)[C@H](NC(=O)c3ccccc3)C(=O)O.\n\nBreaking it down:\n- O=C(O) is a carboxylic acid group.\n- C2CCCN2 is a pyrrolidine ring.\n- C(=O) is another carbonyl group.\n- [C@H] is a chiral center.\n- NC(=O)c3ccccc3 is an amide group attached to a benzene ring.\n- C(=O)O is another carboxylic acid group.\n\nThe carboxyl groups are:\n1. O=C(O)C2CCCN2\n2. C(=O)O at the end.\n\nThe user is asking to delete the carboxyl group, so the answer is to remove the last C(=O)O group.
